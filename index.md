### 👋 Hi, I’m Zihan Suo

I build **systems** and **stories**—blending data insights, AI pipelines and strategies into things that work.

Currently pursuing a dual Master’s in Communication Data Science at Tsinghua University and the University of Southern California, I draw from a background in **product design, data science, marketing strategy and journalism.**

With an interdisciplinary background, I’m especially drawn to the intersection where human stories meet scalable systems — I believe data shouldn’t replace people, but amplify our imagination.

🧭 You can explore my work through:

- 🧠 **AI & Data Systems**: AI Agent Workflows, Machine Learning Projects, Online Opinion Investigations, Data Journalism…
- 🗣 **Communication & Storytelling**: PR & Marketing Campaigns,  Market Analysis, Journalism Works…
- 📦 **Product & UX**: AI Financial News Agent，Fan Support Mini-App, H5 Biography…
