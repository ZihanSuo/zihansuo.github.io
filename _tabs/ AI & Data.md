### The Image of China in Foreign Tourists' Video Narratives
**A Micro-communication Analysis of YouTube Travel Vlogs under the Visa-Free Policy (Python, 2024)**

This study analyzes YouTube vlogs posted by foreign tourists after China’s visa-free policy, using topic modeling, narrative coding, and sentiment analysis on **170k+ subtitles and 2.7k+ comments**.

- Identified how foreign vloggers highlight modernization, technology, and cultural heritage, often from an external, observational lens.
- Observed a sharp rise in both volume and variety of content post-policy, though audience reactions remained diverse and mixed.
- Explored how visa-free travel reshapes China’s image construction in global digital discourse.
